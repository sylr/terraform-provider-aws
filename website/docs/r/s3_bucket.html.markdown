# Resource: aws_s3_bucket

Provides a S3 bucket resource.

-> This functionality is for managing S3 in an AWS Partition. To manage [S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3onOutposts.html), see the [`aws_s3control_bucket`](/docs/providers/aws/r/s3control_bucket.html) resource.

## Example Usage

### Private Bucket w/ Tags

```terraform
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "b" {
  bucket = "my-tf-test-bucket"

  tags = {
    Name        = "My bucket"
    Environment = "Dev"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.b.id
  acl    = "private"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `bucket` - (Optional, Forces new resource) The name of the bucket. If omitted, Terraform will assign a random, unique name. Must be lowercase and less than or equal to 63 characters in length. A full list of bucket naming rules [may be found here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html).
* `bucket_prefix` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Creates a unique bucket name beginning with the specified prefix. Conflicts with `bucket`. Must be lowercase and less than or equal to 37 characters in length. A full list of bucket naming rules [may be found here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html).
* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the bucket. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
* `force_destroy` - (Optional, Default:`false`) A boolean that indicates all objects (including any [locked objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock-overview.html)) should be deleted from the bucket so that the bucket can be destroyed without error. These objects are *not* recoverable.
* `object_lock_configuration` - (Optional) A configuration of [S3 object locking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock.html) (documented below)

The `object_lock_configuration` object supports the following:

* `object_lock_enabled` - (Required) Indicates whether this bucket has an Object Lock configuration enabled. Valid value is `Enabled`.

~> **NOTE on `object_lock_configuration`:** You can only enable S3 Object Lock for new buckets. If you need to turn on S3 Object Lock for an existing bucket, please contact AWS Support.
When you create a bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled, Amazon S3 automatically enables versioning for the bucket.
Once you create a bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled, you can't disable Object Lock or suspend versioning for the bucket.
